                    M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
                    that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
                    you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
                    didn’t hold with such nonsense.

                <p>
                    Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
                    drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a
                    very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
                    usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her
                    time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a
                    small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href=""https://codepen.io/"">The Dursleys</a> had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
                    their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they
                    could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.
                    Dursley’s sister");
            WriteLiteral(@", but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley
                    pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
                    husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
                    to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
                    Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even
                    seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they
                    didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
                    starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and
                    mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley

                <p>
                    To <a href=""https://codepen.io/"">CodePen.io</a> she went, but not brainlessly! Erin ""Oohed"" and ""Ahhed"" at the recently picked pens. She envied the skills of those using compilers she has yet to dabble in. Then she put together a list of what she would like to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Erin chuckled to herself, ""This sounds crazy, but what if I develop a section of text that looks like a book?""
                </p>
                <p>
                    She paused, realizing that what she was about to do was a trend years ago. This severely increased the chance of her project being mocked after launch. What was the specific trend Erin remembered? Skeuomorphism.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>skeu&bull;o&bull;morph</stron");

                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Outside of skeuomorphism, the idea actually was not very silly. Erin always had an appreciation towards print work. The thought of mimicking similar designs onto a web interface has always fascinated her. So, why not start with the classic print design of a novel?
                </p>
                <p>
                    She began to jot down a list of elements that are typically in a novel:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serif typefaces</li>
                    <li>
                        Header area with the title of the book on the left, and the author of said book on the right. <em>Erin is aware that content within the header of the same page as a chapter title does not appe");
            WriteLiteral(@"ar, but she made an exception</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>An adorned chapter title</li>
                    <li>A dropcap for the first letter of the first paragraph of the chapter</li>
                    <li>Indented paragraphs</li>
                    <li>Page numbers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    She was then picturing herself making marks on a novel like she used to in school. In her true fashion, she got carried away with ""What ifs.""
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
